# Common

MADANA Common inherits multiple modules which provide different functionality which is utilized in different products.
All modules are linked with Maven. When the Common project is packaged, all submodules will also be built.

Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
